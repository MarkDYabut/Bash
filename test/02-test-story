THIS IS A STORY
----------
1. Chapter 1 Introduction
once upon a time there was a boy
he grew up spoiled
he hated himself as he grew old
he thought he was high in conscientiousness
but conscientiousness was defined as the wishing to do one's work or duty well and thoroughly, yet he did not regularly make follow-up calls?
but he was a hypocrite
but he was selfish

2. Chapter 2 Analysis
in a day there are 24 hours
in a week there are 24 * 7 = 168 hours
in a week we work 5 * 8 = 40 hours
in a week we sleep 8 * 7 = 56 hours
in a week we have 168 -40 -56 = 72 hours to do other things...
weekends equate to 16 hours of free time
weekdays equate to 8 hours of free time

3. Chapter 3 Summary
so that means that we 72/168 = 43% of our hours we can do other things...
and 100% - 43% = 57% of our hours we spend sleeping and working...

4. Chapter 4 Conclusion
43% time available for other things
57% time available for work and sleep
33% time available on a weekday to do other things
67% time available on a weekend to do other things
