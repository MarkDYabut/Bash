THIS IS AN INSPIRATION LIST
---------
- build a template, then you can duplicate that template
	- the template can be really versatile, where a simple head -5 template > newFileFromTemplateName
	- the template header can have all the useful information required for sorting
	- MARKDOWN FILES!!!! 
	- OBSIDIAN USER INTERFACE!!!!
- getting good at VI is pretty useful; being able to run it all down inside terminal is kind of useful tbh
	- thoughts?
	- journals?
	- blog posts?
	- automate notion outputs, and rename the files??
